## Game Description

**Bringing the classic Snake game to life with JavaScript!**

You've got to avoid **hitting walls** or **your own tail**, or it's **game over.** Are you able to survive for a **long time** and **_score high?_** Let's find out!.
I chose this game because it brings back memories of my childhood when I used to play it on my grandfathers's phone.

## Sound Library

For the game sound/ music I downloaded the music from the source [check it out!](https://opengameart.org/content/eye-of-the-storm).To add the sound in the game script Howler library is utilized. JavaScript library **Howler**.js provides audio management functionality in web applications. The player supports cross-browser playback, volume adjustments, audio sprites, and spatial audio. It is ideal for games, media players, and interactive websites because it is lightweight and efficient.

## List of Technologies Used
